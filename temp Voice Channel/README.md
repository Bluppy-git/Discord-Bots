Bot Information:
The Temp Voice Bot opens a new voice channel,
as soon as you click on a voice channel saved as a join channel.
Then a new voice channel is opened in which you can talk to other users.
As soon as all users have left the Chanel, the voice channel is deleted.
And the best of all: If you create a channel with the bot, you can change the settings of the channel as you like (name, user limit etc.)


Bot commands:
v!addtempchannel <channelid> - Adds the channel as a tempchannel.
v!removetempchannel <channelid> - Removes the Tempchannel.
v!botinfo - shows you information about the Temp Voice.
v!links - sends Links of the Temp Voice Bot.
v!info - shows general Bot statistics.
v!ping - shows the reactiontime of the Bot.
